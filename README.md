# Company Executive
You're the executive, who gives a shit about money?

Control how much money you start with, or just get infinite money each level.

I can't be arsed to figure out Bepin because Bepin is a bitch. Works fine with [BepInEx MLLoader](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInEx_MLLoader/).

Most likely works in multiplayer
